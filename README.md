# Freefolk-Ammunition-Single-Use-Grenades-Temp-Beta

This is a temporary beta, there may be changes before release including but not limited to name, mod ID, balance.

# Known Issues:

MVCF's auto weapon switch isn't currently working for Verb_ShootOneUse, you can use Simple Sidearms to work around this for now.

Unloading reloadable single use weapons and/or stackable weapons can cause issues, until a solution is concivied and implemented please don't unload grenades.

Needs a preview image

Part of development is making a translation example so you may notice labels and such having (translated) at the end, this will be removed before release.
